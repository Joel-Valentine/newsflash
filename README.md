# Newsflash

A simple front end application that will display the latest news, football and travel

### Prerequisites

Basic requirements for this application

```
node v10.15.1
npm 6.4.1
```

### Installing

To view the front end application

```
git clone git@github.com:Midnight-Conqueror/newsflash.git
cd newsflash
npm i
npm run build
```

Then view the index.html within the dist directory.
Alternatively copy /dist/* to a http server directory
in future could setup CI/CD to automatically deploy this

## Running the tests

Currently there are no tests, however now that there is base functionality I would use mocha and chai to create sanity and feature tests

```npm run tests```
